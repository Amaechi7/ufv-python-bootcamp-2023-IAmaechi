# Python Coin Toss Challenge

# Welcome to the Coin Toss Program!
# In this challenge, you will simulate a virtual coin toss.
# When you run the program, it should randomly print "Heads" or "Tails".

# Remember:
# - The first letter should be capitalised e.g. "Heads" or "Tails".
# - Use the random module to achieve randomness in your program.

# ðŸš¨ Don't forget to import the necessary module(s) at the top of the file.

# Let's see if you can get your program to decide: Heads or Tails!

# TODO: Import necessary modules

# TODO: Generate a random number (either 0 or 1)

# TODO: Use the random number to print "Heads" or "Tails"
