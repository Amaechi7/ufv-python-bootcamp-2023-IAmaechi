# Python Treasure Map Challenge

# Welcome to the "Treasure Map" Program!
# In this challenge, you'll place a treasure on a given map.
# You will input a two-digit number: the first digit for the column and the second for the row.
# Your goal is to mark the given position on the map with an "X".

# Let's find out: Where is the treasure?

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️", "️⬜️", "️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️", "⬜️", "️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️", "⬜️️", "⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# TODO: Using the input value, mark the correct position with an "X" on the map.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
