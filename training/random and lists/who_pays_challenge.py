# Python Who Pays the Bill Challenge

# Welcome to the "Who Pays the Bill" Program!
# In this challenge, you'll write a program that randomly selects a name from a list.
# The selected person will be responsible for everyone's meal bill today.
# Remember, you are NOT allowed to use the choice() function.

# Let's find out: Who is paying today?

# TODO: Import the necessary module(s) to add randomness to your program.

# Already provided: Get all names from the user.
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")

# TODO: Without using the choice() function, determine who will pay.
