    #  Install Python Extension: Ensure you have the Python extension installed in VSCode.
    #  Open the File in VSCode: Open the problematic Python file in Visual Studio Code.
    #  Set Breakpoints: Click on the left margin next to the line numbers where you suspect the error might be. A red dot will appear, indicating a breakpoint. When you run the debugger, the execution will pause at these breakpoints.
    #  Start the Debugger: Press F5 or click on the green "Run" arrow at the top left. Select Python File as the environment.
    #  Inspect the Errors: The debugger will run the code until it encounters an error or a breakpoint. You can see variables' values, step through the code line by line, etc.
    #  Check the Terminal: The errors will also be displayed in the terminal at the bottom. Pay close attention to the error messages; they often give clear indications of what's wrong.
