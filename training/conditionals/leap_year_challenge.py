# In this challenge, you are tasked with determining if a given year is a leap year.

# REMINDER:
# 1. The year should be divisible by 4.
# 2. If the year is divisible by 100, it should also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
# Your task is to implement these checks and print "Leap year." if the conditions are met
# and "Not leap year." otherwise.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
