# In this challenge, you're tasked with interpreting the Body Mass Index (BMI)

# - Interpretations are as follows:
#   - Under 18.5: Underweight
#   - Over 18.5 but below 25: Normal weight
#   - Over 25 but below 30: Slightly overweight
#   - Over 30 but below 35: Obese
#   - Above 35: Clinically obese

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
