# Python Love Calculator Challenge

# This is a fun challenge that will test the compatibility between two people!

# Your task is to compute a love score based on the names of two people.
# Here's how you should calculate the score:

# 1. Count the number of times the letters in the word "TRUE" occur in both names.
# 2. Count the number of times the letters in the word "LOVE" occur in both names.
# 3. Combine these numbers to make a 2-digit number.

# Based on the combined number:
# - If the score is less than 10 or greater than 90, display:
#   "Your score is x, you go together like coke and mentos."
# - If the score is between 40 and 50, display:
#   "Your score is y, you are alright together."
# - Otherwise, just display their score like:
#   "Your score is z."

# Hints:
# - Convert the strings to lowercase to make your counting case-insensitive.
# - Use the count() method to find the occurrence of each letter in the string.
# - Carefully format the print output to match the examples!

# Good luck! Let's see how compatible you are with your crush!

print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

# TODO: First, convert both names to lowercase.

# TODO: Count the number of times letters from 'TRUE' appear.

# TODO: Count the number of times letters from 'LOVE' appear.

# TODO: Combine the counts to get the love score.

# TODO: Display the love score and the appropriate message based on the score.
