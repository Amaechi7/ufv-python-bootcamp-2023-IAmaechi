# Python Pizza Challenge

# Congratulations on your new job at Python Pizza!
# Your first assignment is to create an automatic pizza order program.

# Here's a breakdown of the pricing:
# Small Pizza: $15
# Medium Pizza: $20
# Large Pizza: $25
# Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
# Extra cheese for any size pizza: +$1

# Use the information above to calculate the final bill based on the user's input.

# Example:
# For a large pizza with pepperoni but no extra cheese, the final bill should be $28.

# Hint:
# You might want to use multiple if statements.
# Can you find a way to reduce the number of lines of code while maintaining the same functionality?

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L ")
add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# TODO: Based on the user's input, determine the base price of the pizza.

# TODO: Determine the cost of adding pepperoni. Remember, it's different for different pizza sizes!

# TODO: Check if the user wants extra cheese, and adjust the bill accordingly.

# TODO: Print the final bill amount.
