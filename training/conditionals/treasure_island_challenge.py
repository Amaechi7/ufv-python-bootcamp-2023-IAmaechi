# Python Treasure Island Challenge

# Welcome brave adventurer!
# Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to find the hidden treasure on Treasure Island.

# Your journey will be fraught with decisions and only the wise will succeed.
# At every step of your adventure, you'll have to make a choice.
# Based on your choice, your journey will either continue or come to a tragic end.

# Beware! Not all choices will lead you to the treasure.
# Use your wit and intuition. Choose wisely!

# The game begins at a crossroad, and you must decide whether to go left or right.
# If you choose correctly, you will come across a lake, where you must decide to wait or swim.
# And if you still manage to make the right choice, you'll reach a house with three colored doors.
# Behind one of the doors is the treasure, but behind the others, doom awaits.

# Are you ready to embark on this perilous journey?

# Good luck adventurer! May you find the treasure!
