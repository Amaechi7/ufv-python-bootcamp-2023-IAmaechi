# In this challenge, you need to determine whether a given number is even or odd.

# REMINDER:
# - Even numbers are numbers that can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# - The modulo operator (%) in Python gives you the remainder after a division.
#   For example, 6 % 2 = 0 (because 6 is evenly divisible by 2)
#   and 5 % 2 = 1 (because the remainder when 5 is divided by 2 is 1).

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
