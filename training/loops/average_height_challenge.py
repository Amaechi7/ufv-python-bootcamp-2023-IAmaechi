# Python Average Height Challenge

# Welcome to the "Average Height" Program!
# In this challenge, you'll be calculating the average student height from a given list.
# You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer.
# Instead, try to replicate their functionality using a for loop.

# Let's find out: What's the average height?

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# TODO: Calculate the average height from the student_heights list and print the result.
