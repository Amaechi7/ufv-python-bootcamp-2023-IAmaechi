# ufv-python-bootcamp-2023

## Introduction

Welcome to the Challenge Exercises repository for UFV Python Bootcamp 2023! These exercises are designed to challenge you, make you think critically, and deepen your understanding of Python programming. Remember, the aim is not just to find the "correct" answer but to understand why that answer is correct.

## Why Participate in These Challenges?

1. **Reinforcement**: Strengthen what you have learned in the bootcamp.
2. **Depth of Understanding**: Challenges will help you understand Python more deeply.
3. **Creativity**: Use this opportunity to think creatively and learn how to solve problems.

## How to Approach the Challenges

### Guidelines

1. **Different Complexities**: Challenges range from easy to difficult.
2. **Context Provided**: Each challenge comes with a context to make the problem relatable.
3. **Different Topics**: Exercises span various Python topics, from basic syntax to data structures.
4. **Time Management**: Time-bound challenges add a real-world aspect.
5. **Hint System**: Stuck? Use the graduated hint system without looking at the solution.

### Warnings

- Please try to solve each challenge **on your own** before looking at the provided solutions.
- **It's okay to struggle or fail**. This is a learning process; it's more important to understand the solution rather than just reaching it.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Correctness**: Is your code achieving what was asked?
2. **Pythonic Idioms**: Are you using Python-specific optimizations?
3. **Code Quality**: Is your code readable and well-commented?

## Conclusion

Each time you face a challenge, remember, it's not a test but an opportunity to grow. So take each challenge seriously and do your best to solve it without peeking at the solution. And most importantly, remember that we learn more from failure than from success.
